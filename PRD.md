## Design Direction

The design should feel professional and trustworthy, like enterprise document management software but with modern consumer-app polish. It balances efficiency (quick access to tools) with clarity (obvious what each action does). The interface should feel calm and organized, not cluttered, with generous white space and clear visual grouping. A minimal interface serves the core purpose - users focus on their documents, not learning the UI.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme - using blue for primary actions (trust, professionalism), neutral grays for backgrounds (calm, unobtrusive), and strategic use of the blue accent for interactive elements.

- **Primary Color**: Vibrant Blue (#2970FF) - conveys trust, professionalism, and action; used for primary buttons and key interactive elements
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays (#414651 for text, #E9EAEB for borders) - provides subtle contrast without competing for attention
- **Accent Color**: Same as primary (#2970FF) - creates cohesive action language throughout the interface
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background 1 (White #FFFFFF): Dark gray text (#414651) - Ratio 9.8:1 ✓
  - Background 2 (Light Gray #F4F4F6): Dark gray text (#414651) - Ratio 9.2:1 ✓
  - Primary (Blue #2970FF): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 5.1:1 ✓
  - Secondary (White #FFFFFF with border #E9EAEB): Dark gray text (#414651) - Ratio 9.8:1 ✓
  - Cards (White #FFFFFF): Dark gray text (#414651) - Ratio 9.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should communicate clarity and professionalism without feeling corporate or stiff. Inter is the perfect choice - highly legible at all sizes, modern but not trendy, designed specifically for UI work.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Title): Inter SemiBold/32px/tight letter spacing (-0.02em)
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/20px/normal spacing
  - H3 (Tool Names): Inter Medium/16px/normal spacing
  - Body (Instructions): Inter Regular/14px/relaxed line height (1.6)
  - Buttons: Inter Medium/14px/normal spacing
  - Captions (File info): Inter Regular/12px/muted color

## Animations

Animations should feel responsive and purposeful, never delaying the user's work. Subtle motion reinforces actions and helps users understand cause and effect.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Buttons have gentle press feedback, page selections feel tactile with scale, upload areas pulse gently when drag-hovering
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary actions (generate PDF) get satisfying completion animations, secondary interactions (hover states) are subtle fades

## Component Selection

- **Components**: 
  - **Tabs** (shadcn v4) - mode switching between View, Extract, Split, and Redact
  - **Button** (primary/outline/ghost variants) - all action triggers, customized with exact brand colors
  - **Card** - PDF document containers
  - **Badge** - selection counters and status indicators
  - **Progress** - file processing indicators
  - **Separator** - visual grouping of toolbar sections
  - **ScrollArea** - thumbnail grid and page list
  - **Dialog** (via sonner toast) - notifications and error messages

- **Customizations**: 
  - Custom PDF viewer component with thumbnail grid and zoom controls
  - Custom redaction drawing canvas overlay with click-drag interaction
  - Custom drag-and-drop file upload zone with visual feedback
  - Custom page selection interface with visual checkmarks

- **States**: 
  - Buttons: default, hover (subtle scale), active (pressed effect), disabled (reduced opacity)
  - Pages: default, hover (subtle opacity), selected (primary ring + checkmark icon), current (primary ring for redaction)
  - Upload zone: default, drag-over (border highlight), uploading (progress bar), error (destructive toast)
  - Toolbar: sticky with backdrop blur, collapses contextual actions based on selected mode

  - FilePlus (add PDF), Scissors (split), CopySimple (extract), ArrowsInLineVertical (compress), PaintBucket (redact), Download (export/download), Trash (clear/delete), MagnifyingGlassPlus/Minus (zoom), Eye (view mode), Check (selected indicator)

- **Spacing**: 
  - Container padding: p-6
  - Toolbar: p-4 with gap-4 between sections
  - Card gaps: gap-4
  - Button groups: gap-2
  - Section spacing: space-y-6
  - Thumbnail grid: gap-6 (vertical stacking)
